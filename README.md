One of the requirements to become Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors is to create and publish a website on Azure. By completing this task, I am proud to carry my milestone in the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program from Alpha to Beta. I wanted to present you this excellent application that I have developed with the Microsoft product.

Open to improvements. You can contact me for any questions.

Thanks.
